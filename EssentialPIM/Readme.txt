Very Important! If you did not get EssentialPIM from our web page, but from another source such as a magazine CD or software library, make sure to visit our home page. You'll most probably find a newer version, because we release updates about once a month.

To install EssentialPIM, just run the "essentialpim3.exe" and follow the instructions. You'll want to select the target directory and the components to install.

- Visit EssentialPIM home page in the Internet at http://www.essentialpim.com/. There's a good chance of finding a newer version of EssentialPIM. If a serious bug has been found, but the new version is not ready yet, we'll make a hot fix for it.
